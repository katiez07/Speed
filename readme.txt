Welcome to Speed!! This language is written by Katie Zucker, based off a combination of C and Scam, which was written by John Lusth based off Scheme, which was written at MIT based off Lisp. I have also added my own modifications to better suit my purposes for this language.

This is a language designed specifically so that you can type it as fast as possible.

For this reason, lists are separated by only spaces without commas, and parentheses and braces have been replaced with symbols which optimize typing efficiency.

Another goal of this language is for it to be simple and functional. For this reason, operators are functions, and so are arrays and so is a while loop.

Code examples:

// variable
var a;
= ;' a 2 ';;

// function
func times2 ;' a ';
./
	return * ;' a 2 ';
/.
