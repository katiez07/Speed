test1
-----
This is a very simple, successful test.

test2
-----
This is a failure test.

test3
-----
This uses my original program.txt from my grammar, which includes every rule. This test is also successful. :)

run
---
"make run" runs the tests in this order: test1, test3, test2. This is because I didn't know how to make a failed test2 not immediately quit.
